# 👋 Welcome to Week 1

Hey everyone! 🎉  
Welcome to Week 1 of the program — we're excited to have you on board.

This week, you'll be getting hands-on with your first assignment.

## 📚 Week 1 Assignment

➡️ [Click here to access the assignment on GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/a/JX-p5Jrq)

### 🛠️ How it works

- When you **accept the assignment**, GitHub Classroom will:
  - **Create a copy (fork)** of the starter repository for you
  - Give you your own **private repo** where you’ll work
  - Automatically assign you as the repo owner with **write access**

You’ll write your code directly in your repo and push changes there.
We’ll also be able to view your work, give feedback, and track progress.

If you have any questions, drop them in the week-1 channel. Let’s crush Week 1! 🚀
