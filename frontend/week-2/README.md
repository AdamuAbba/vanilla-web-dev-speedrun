# 👋 Welcome to Week 2

Hey everyone! 🎉  
Welcome to Week 2 of the program — We are so proud of you for making it this far! 🙌

This week, you'll be getting hands-on with your second assignment which builds on the skills you learned in Week 1.

## 📚 Week 2 Assignment

➡️ [Click here to access the assignment on GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/a/UEuqaBmt)

### 🛠️ How it works

- When you **accept the assignment**, GitHub Classroom will:
  - **Create a copy (fork)** of the starter repository for you
  - Give you your own **public repo** (💪🏾 for the open source culture) where you’ll work
  - Automatically assign you as the repo owner with **admin access**

You’ll write your code directly in your repo and push changes there.
We’ll also be able to view your work, give feedback, and track progress.

If you have any questions, drop them in the week-2 channel. We crushed week 1, let's do the same for week 2  🚀
